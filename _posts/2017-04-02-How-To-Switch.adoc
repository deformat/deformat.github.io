:hp-alt-title: How To Switch

So I was tutoring someone on how they could apply nested if-else statements for the rules of leap years. For instance...

----
int year;
cin >> year;

if(year % 100 == 0)
{
    if(year % 400 == 0)
        cout << "29 days\n";
    else
        cout << "28 days\n";
}
else
{
    if(year % 4 == 0)
        cout << "29 days\n";
    else
        cout << " 28 days\n";
}
----

As my "pupil" was figuring out the code, I wondered out loud if you could turn this into a switch statement. A colleague sitting behind me said no because switch statements only consider the value of a variable, not whether it's divisible by anything. Suddenly a vision came and I started jotting this down:

----
int year, remainder;
cin >> year;
remainder = year % 400;
		
switch (remainder)
{
	case 0: cout << "29 days" << endl;
		break;
	case 4: cout << "29 days" << endl;
		break;
	case 100: cout << "28 days" << endl;
		break;
	case 200: cout << "28 days" << endl;
		break;
	case 300: cout << "28 days" << endl;
		break;
	default: cout << "28 days" << endl;
}
----

"Yes!" I declared. "This works! It says 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 and 2100 are not! And it works for everything inbetween!

2000 = LEAP YEAR +
2001 = NOT LEAP YEAR +
2002 = NOT LEAP YEAR +
2003 = NOT LEAP YEAR +
2004 = LEAP YEAR +
2005 = NOT LEAP YEAR +
2006 = NOT LEAP YEAR +
2007 = NOT LEAP YEAR +
2008 = ...Not leap year?

My colleague laughed. "You need to set a case for every multiple of four within 400!" he teased. Well, alright! That's...little less than a hundred cases? I can get that done!

About 20 cases in, my laziness realized "Wait, I can just make a program to write the switch statement for me!" So...

----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int remainder = 0;

	cout << "\t\tswitch (remainder)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tcase " 
		<< remainder << ": cout << \"29 days\" << endl;\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n";

	remainder += 4;
	
	while (remainder < 400)
	{
		if (remainder % 100 != 0)
			cout << "\t\t\tcase " << remainder << ": cout << \"29 days\" << endl;\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n";
		remainder += 4;
	}

	cout << "\t\t\tdefault: cout << \"28 days\" << endl;\n\t\t}";
}

----

Then I could send the output to a text file and paste the result into my code!

----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int year, remainder;
	cout << "Enter year: ";
	cin >> year;
	while (year != -1)
	{
		remainder = year % 400;
		
		switch (remainder)

== But...why do any of this?

Okay, so using large switch statements is rarely useful when an if-else statement could work it much faster, but hey, at least we CAN do it! Shows the power of switch statements, no?

== It's 200 lines of code.

It's unwieldy, yes. But! So long as I can write a program to do most of the busywork, it's not so bad!

== But you don't even have to check all these cases!

Huh?

== You could apply the same logic you used at the beginning, but instead of a nested if-else statement, use a nested switch statement.

----
int remain4 = year % 4;
int remain100 = year % 100;
int remain400 = year % 400;
        
// Check if divisible by 100
switch (remain100)
{
    //Check if divisible by 400
    case 0:
        switch (remain400)
        {
            case 0: cout << "29 days\n";
                    break;
            default: cout << "28 days\n";
        }
        break;
    //Check if divisible by 4
    default:
        switch(remain4)
        {
            case 0: cout << "29 days\n";
                    break;
            default: cout << "28 days\n";
        }
}

== It works just the same without having to write code just to write the code!

...Oh.
