:hp-alt-title: Weekly Roundup

Starting weekly updates on my being. First order of business:

== _Accessibility!_

My first comedy _Will Do_ finally includes English closed captions. I continuously complain about online videos not being accessible to the deaf and hard-of-hearing; it's about time I started practicing what I preach.

Captioning with Adobe Premiere 2017 is much smoother than it used to be. It's still buggy (center-align needs a lot of manual adjusting), but sliding and editing captions with the mouse rather than setting specific times for every in-point and out-point (the horror...the boredom...the wrist pain) is just what I've needed all these years.

== _A new radio show!_

This is a week old, but I'm still proud of my latest After Effects experiment: _Matt Pala Radio Simulcast_.

It's my first video in a long time that's 100% original content. Even the drums I sampled for the theme song are Creative Commons Attribution (commercial use allowed so long as I cite (TicTacShutUp at Freesound.org)). I could profit from this if I wanted to. That's such a powerful feeling.

Too bad the show's already cancelled.
